# capability-based-access-control-CBAC-in-IoT
CBAC is an access control model that uses capabilities to grant access to resources. Capabilities are small pieces of data that represent access to a resource. CBAC is a promising approach for IoT security because it can be used to secure resource-constrained devices.
